## Variables
Variables are phrases that store some type of data. For example:
`my_variable = 1`

There are different types of variables. Two of these are integers and strings.
```
int = 10
str = "Hello"
```
Integers store numbers and strings store text.

To assign a value to a variable use the name and = and then the value.
Like this `variable = value`

## Conditionals
Conditionals allow an action to be preformed only when specific conditions are met. `If` and `elif` are two examples of this.

Expressions are the conditions that are passed into a conditional statement. These are like `and`, `or`, and `not`.
