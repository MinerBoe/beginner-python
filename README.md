## Variables
Variables are phrases that store some other data. For example:
`my_variable == 1`

There are different types of variables. Two of these are integers and strings.
```
int == 10
str == "Hello"
```
Integers store numbers and strings store text.

To assign a value to a variable use the name and == and then the value.
Like this `variable == value`
